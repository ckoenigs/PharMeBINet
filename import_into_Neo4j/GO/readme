First, the script downloads the latest version of Gene Ontology (GO).

Then the OBO file from the GO will be transformed into node and relationship CSV with the program of EFO/transform_obo_to_csv_and_cypher_file.py go-basic.obo GO go
All terms are a node in GO all property-value pairs in OBO are a property in the node except for property key='is_a' and 'relationship'. They are for generating a different kind of relationships of the OBO file.
Additionally, the cypher queries for the node and the different kinds of relationships are generated. After this, the data will be integrated into Neo4j with the Neo4j shell.

Next the the phenotype_anotation file is handled. There a file for the disease nodes is generated and files for the relationships between disease ['id', 'name', 'source'] and symptom ['disease_id', 'phenotype_id', 'qualifier', 'evidence_code', 'source', 'frequency_modifier','aspect', 'onset', 'sex', 'modifier', 'biocuration'].
Therefore it runs through all lines and combines the information of equal disease symptom pairs.

In the last step, the nodes and relationships are integrated into Neo4j with the cypher queries from the different programs!

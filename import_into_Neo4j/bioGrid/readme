Version: BIOGRID-4.4.198

First, the data for chemical gene interaction are downloaded. The for every row in the CSV file the gene, chemical information are extracted and written into a dictionary or the CSV file. However, only the edges are added into a new CSV if the genes are human genes. Additionally, for the relationships and the chemicals, the cypher queries are generated. Also, the Interaction is a node, because sometimes more than one gene and one chemical are related!

Next, the BIOGRID-Organisms are downloaded and only the human file is taken. First, the relationship file and the cypher query are generated. Then for each row in the CSV file, the gene information is extracted. The relationships where both genes are human genes are added to the relationship CSV. The file contains also some ontology information which is separated into different categories and write into a CSV file. Also, the interactions are nodes too.

Last the combined gene information from both files is written into a CSV file.

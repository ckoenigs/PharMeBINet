The JSON file of MONDO is downloaded from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.json.

Version: 2021-07-12

The script first downloads the latest version of MONDO as a JSON file.
Then in the python script, the CSV for node and edges and cypher file are generated. Therefore, only the nodes with IRI that start with 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO' are taken. The others are from other databases.
Also, deprecated nodes are excluded.
Additionally, all edges are run through and take only the edges where both nodes are from mondo.
In the last step, the information from the CSV files is integrated into the Neo4j database.

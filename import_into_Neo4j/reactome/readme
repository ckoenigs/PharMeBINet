This program can combine any two labels which have a relationship and make one big node with all relationship from both nodes.
It can be decided if the relationships between this label node should still exist or not after the merging.
Also, the program needs the information which direction the relationship has.
The last argument is optional but add a label to the combined node.

In the program may be the username (of neo4j) and the password needs to change into yours.

This is the example for Target merging
python combine_nodes.py target_dictionary chembl_id_lookup True False Target

In the end, you have to use neo4j-shell -file cypher_file.cypher

The program gets at least 4 parameters but can also have a 5.
1: node label which should be merged into another label
2: node label where new information is merged in 
3:  can be True or False by true no self-loops are allowed
4: can be True or False    
    by True: the relationship between label 1 and label 2 is label1->label2
    by False: label1 <- label2
(5: optional: gives the combined node an additional label)

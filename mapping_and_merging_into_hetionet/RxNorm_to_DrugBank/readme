The idea is from https://think-lab.github.io/d/40/ but it is only the basic idea.

The results of the different programmes are in results

First the file map_rxnorm_to_unii_final.py must be executed, therefore the database RxNorm in MySQL is needed. The User and the password need to be changed. 
This file load all RxNorm Cui with unii in a file. 

The second file which needs to be executed is unii_to_rxnorm_cui_final.py. This uses the FDA-SRS database (https://fdasis.nlm.nih.gov/srs/srs.jsp) to get
further RxNorm Cuis and unii pairs.

The third file is combine_rxnorm_and_fda_srs_to_a_rxnorm_unii_inchkey_file.py which combine both files from before and get further inchikey from FDA-SRS for the different UNIIs.

The fourth file is map_rxcui_to_drugbank_with_unii_inchikey_final.py. This uses the InChIKey and UNIIs from DurgBank to map to the RxNorm CUI which are mapped to UNII and InChIKey.

Further, exist a mapping between RxCUI and DrugBank ID with use of the DrugBank names and search for them in the RxNorm database. This is in file map_drugbank_to_rxnorm_with_name_final.py.

All these files can be executed with the script. But at least the DrugBank file must be prepared.

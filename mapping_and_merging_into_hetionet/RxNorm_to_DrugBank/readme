The idea is from https://think-lab.github.io/d/40/ but it is only the basic idea.

First the file map_rxnorm_to_unii_final.py must be executed, therefore the database RxNorm in MySQL is needed. The User and the password need to be changed. 
This file load all RxNorm Cui with unii in a file. 

Second file which need to be execute is unii_to_rxnorm_cui_final.py. This use the FDA-SRS database (https://fdasis.nlm.nih.gov/srs/srs.jsp) to get
further RxNorm Cuis and unii pairs.

Third file is combine_rxnorm_and_fda_srs_to_a_rxnorm_unii_inchkey_file.py which combine the both files from before and get further inchikey from FDA-SRS for the different uniis.

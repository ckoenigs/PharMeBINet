The parser from XML to tsv is based on https://github.com/dhimmel/drugbank/blob/gh-pages/parse.ipynb but some additional properties are added to the tsv.
The DrugBank database can be download on https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest. It was used the version 5.0 from 20.09.17.
This I did with python 3.5.3 on windows.

The other programme separates the DrugBank ids with chemical information and without into two files.

This can be executed with the shell.

Further is DrugBank integrated into Hetionet with the program integrate_DrugBank_with_interaction_into_hetionet.py.


Some properties were double in the compound but with different values content and some were outsourced like salt and categories.

Match (n:Compound) Remove n.brands, n.categories, n.categories_category_mesh_id, n.external_identifiers, n.licenses, n.no_further_chemical_information, n.pubChem, n.pubChem_id, n.salt_names, n.salt_uniis, n.salt_inchikeys

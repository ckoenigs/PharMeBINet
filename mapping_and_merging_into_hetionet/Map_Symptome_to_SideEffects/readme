This program generate a connection between side effects and symptomes based on the mapping of MESH ID to UMLS CUI and UMLSC CUI symptom to UMLS CUI side effects.

First take for all symptomes the UMLS cui or get the UMLS cuis from the MESH ID in UMLS (optimal only the UMLS cuis with the same name else all with the MESH ID). 
All connection are in map/.

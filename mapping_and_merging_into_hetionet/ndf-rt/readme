Map and merge first the NDF-RT disease than the NDF-RT drugs.

NDF-RT disease and Disease Ontology have UMLS cui as extern key.
First step map the UMLS cui directly.
Second search for synonym UMLS cuis in UMLS am map then.

For mapping NDF-RT drug to DrugBank different mwthodes are used:
1) Map the RxNorm cui of the NDF-RT to DrugBank by using RxNorm
2) Map RxNorm cui to DrugBank by using RxNorm-DrugBank table, which was generated with use of inchikey and unii 
3) Use the unii from NDF-RT drugs and map with use of unii-drugbank table. This table was generate by using DrugBank. 
4) Use rxcui to map to drugbank by using the table where drugbank name/synonyms/brands/products are mapped to rxcui in rxnorm(new mapped: 17)
(mapped:2155, not mapped:10218)
5) use association of ndf-rt drug to his ingredient and if the ingredient has a drugbank id then it gets the same. (new mapped: 9031)
(mapped:11686, not mapped:687)
6)use the umls cui from ndf-rt drug and map in UMLS to drugbank (new mapped: 1)
(mapped:11687, not mapped:686)

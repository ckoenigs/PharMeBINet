Map and merge first the NDF-RT disease than the NDF-RT drugs.

NDF-RT disease and Disease Ontology have UMLS cui as extern key.
First step map the UMLS cui directly.
Search for synonym UMLS cuis in UMLS am map then.


1) Map the rxcui of the NDF-RT to Drugbank by using rxnorm database
(mapped:1381, not mapped: 10992)
2) Map rxcui to drugbank by using rxnorm-drugbank table, which was generated with use of inchikey and unii (new mapped: 517)
(mapped:1898, not mapped:10475)
3) Use the unii from NDF-RT drugs and map with use of unii-drugbank table. Thic table was generate by using durgbank (new mapped: 340)
(mapped:2138, not mapped:10235)
4) Use rxcui to map to drugbank by using the table where drugbank name/synonyms/brands/products are mapped to rxcui in rxnorm(new mapped: 17)
(mapped:2155, not mapped:10218)
5) use association of ndf-rt drug to his ingredient and if the ingredient has a drugbank id then it gets the same. (new mapped: 9031)
(mapped:11686, not mapped:687)
6)use the umls cui from ndf-rt drug and map in UMLS to drugbank (new mapped: 1)
(mapped:11687, not mapped:686)

Fist map and integrate the aeolus aoutcome and the the aeolus drugs and the connection.
The outcome can be simple mapped to UMLS cui because AEOLUS coutcome has as identifier MedDRA and this is part of UMLS and is integratet into Hetionet.

The mapping of the AEOLUS drugs has many different methodes:
1. Mapped RXNORM cui to Drugbank ids with use of RXNORM database.
2. Mapped RXNORM cui to Drugbank ids with a mapped table which used the unii and InChIKey
3. Mapped RXNORM cui to Drugbank ids with a mapped table, which was generated with name mapping. 

The it is integratet into Hetionet. Also for the relationship a cypher file is generated.

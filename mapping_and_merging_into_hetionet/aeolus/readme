Fist map and integrate the AEOLUS outcome and the AEOLUS drugs and the connection.
The outcome can be simply mapped to UMLS cui because AEOLUS outcome has as identifier MedDRA and this is part of UMLS and is integrated into Hetionet.

The mapping of the AEOLUS drugs has many different methods:
1. Mapped RXNORM cui to Drugbank ids with use of RXNORM database.
2. Mapped RXNORM cui to Drugbank ids with a mapped table which used the unii and InChIKey
3. Mapped RXNORM cui to Drugbank ids with a mapped table, which was generated with name mapping. 

It is integrated into Hetionet. Also for the relationship, a cypher file is generated.

ATC is mapped to Pharmacological Class (PC) and Chemical. 
First, the ATC nodes are mapped to the Chemical which has an ATC code. (The others are mapped to PC with name mapping.[This is excluded because in ATC multiple with the same name can appear in the different steps of the hierarchy])
The nodes that are not mapped will generate new PC nodes. All mappings and the new node get an own tsv file. 
Additionally, a cypher file is generated with the different integration of mapping information and the new PC nodes. All are integrated with the cypher-shell tool.

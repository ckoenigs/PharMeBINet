GO script contains multiple steps.
First, the new GO map to the old GO (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function):
               First, all properties are extracted from the GO nodes and prepared in a cypher string. Also, a cypher file is generated for the cypher query to delete old GO nodes which do not exists anymore.
               The next step is to generate for each label  (BP, CC, MF) a mapped and a new node TSV file, and the fitting cypher file is generated and add to the cypher file.
               In the following, the BP, CC, and MF information from the database is added to a dictionary. Also, the is_a relationships of GO are extracted and wrote into TSV files. Additionally, cypher queries for integrate these relationships are generated and add to the cypher file.
               In the last step, the GO nodes are mapped by their own GO identifier and the alternative GO identifiers. All pairs are written in the TSV file. If not mapped then the node is written into the new node TSV file. Also, if multiple nodes map to the same GO identifier then the others are added to the merge script.
Then the information is integrated into the database with the cypher-shell.
Next, the merge nodes script is executed.
In the last step, the delete nodes cypher is executed to remove all BP, CC, or MF which did not map to GO.

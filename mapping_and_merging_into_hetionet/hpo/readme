The HPO diseases were mapped with name mapping, UMLS, OMIM ID, and ORPHA ID.

I took from HPO only the phenotypes which are part of the Phenotypic abnormality hierarchy as symptoms to map and the ones that do not map generate a new node with HPO id as an identifier. 
This was done by getting the disease-phenotype association with aspect P. Then by trying to map the mesh id UMLS and name mapping were used!

The relationships between disease and symptom are only the relationships with aspect P.
